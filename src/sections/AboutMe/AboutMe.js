            Hello! My name is Dat. I was born in 1998 in Nha Trang City, a
            stunning beach. I studied and graduated with a software engineering
            major in Ho Chi Minh City University of Science in 2020.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have three years of experience in front-end development. I am
            confident that I have deep knowledge of necessary languages and
            technologies for Front-end.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&apos;m willing to learn new things, and not afraid of complex
            tasks. I always try to read and stay up to date with the latest
            technology news.
          </p>
